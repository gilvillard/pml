* indent = soft tab, 4 spaces
* please avoid spaces/tabs at end of line

* please insert emacs+vim modelines at the end of new files, as follows:
// Local Variables:
// mode: C++
// tab-width: 4
// indent-tabs-mode: nil
// c-basic-offset: 4
// End:
// vim:sts=4:sw=4:ts=4:et:sr:cino=>s,f0,{0,g0,(0,\:0,t0,+0,=s

* when there is a todo (functionality, doc, comment to write...): write "todo"
  in a comment

* delimiters {..} :
  -- not required for "one-line" if/for/... , for example
		  for(blabla)
		    if(bli)
		      one instruction;
  -- at beginning of line:
       for (blabla)
       {

TODO Vincent
   - Finishing PM-Basis (incorporate middle product, some profiling to
avoid stupid mistakes) and comparing it with LinBox's one and with the
GCD in the small dimension case.
   - some first attempts show that our PM-Basis is noticeably slower
than NTL's GCD for similar problem dimensions. I hope to understand this
(NTL's gcd seems quite readable) and maybe improve PM-Basis with some
ideas from NTL.
   - The "point-wise PM-Basis". I am thinking of a general version
assuming anything on the points, and also specialized versions working
with FFT points or with geometric points; does that sound good?
