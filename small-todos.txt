* indent = soft tab, 4 spaces
* please avoid spaces/tabs at end of line

* please insert emacs+vim modelines at the end of new files, as follows:
// Local Variables:
// mode: C++
// tab-width: 4
// indent-tabs-mode: nil
// c-basic-offset: 4
// End:
// vim:sts=4:sw=4:ts=4:et:sr:cino=>s,f0,{0,g0,(0,\:0,t0,+0,=s

* when there is a todo (functionality, doc, comment to write...): write "todo"
  in a comment

* delimiters {..} :
  -- not required for "one-line" if/for/... , for example
		  for(blabla)
		    if(bli)
		      one instruction;
  -- at beginning of line:
       for (blabla)
       {
           blibli
       }


TODO Vincent
   - Finishing PM-Basis (power series version):
      * some profiling to avoid stupid mistakes
      * finalize mbasis by merging the existing ones
      * compare with LinBox's pmbasis
      * compare with NTL's GCD when dimension is 2x1
   - Matrix multiplication:
      * FFT: decide on which algo (more thresholds?)
      * do similar improvement for geometric and others
      * test on a machine with more cores
   - Uniform interpolants:
      * improve mbasis so that it always works (see mbasis-approx)
      * pmbasis
      * interpolant basis verification: generation
