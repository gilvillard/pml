* agree on indent (4 spaces?) and find a way to make this go smoothly with our editors (modelines? Luca's trick?)
  --> Vincent: still have to work with 4 spaces choice, will then update my files

* when we are writing code and notice that there is a todo (functionality, doc,
  comment to write...): let's write "todo" in a comment right away, before it
  is forgotten and becomes difficult to find

* delimiters {..} :
  -- always put them even for "one-line" if/for/...  ?
  -- or allow ourselves shorter code such as
  for(blabla)
    if(bli)
      one instruction;

* please avoid spaces/tabs at end of line

* write actual docstrings?
  -- possibly for extracting into an html doc, but
  -- mostly for forcing us to document everything in a way that is more
  informative than the big header lines of /*-----*/ before every function (and
  which will be easier to work with since editors are used to these docstrings)


TODO Vincent
   - Generic determinant. This should be very easy via PM-Basis and
multiplication.
   - Finishing PM-Basis (incorporate middle product, some profiling to
avoid stupid mistakes) and comparing it with LinBox's one and with the
GCD in the small dimension case.
   - some first attempts show that our PM-Basis is noticeably slower
than NTL's GCD for similar problem dimensions. I hope to understand this
(NTL's gcd seems quite readable) and maybe improve PM-Basis with some
ideas from NTL.
   - The "point-wise PM-Basis". I am thinking of a general version
assuming anything on the points, and also specialized versions working
with FFT points or with geometric points; does that sound good?
