TODO Vincent
   - PM-Basis (power series version, some remarks shared with interpolants):
      * work on thresholds (mbasis_rescomp/resupdate, and pmbasis base case)
			* specific code for dimension 2x1 (and compare with NTL's GCD / BerlekampMassey)
			* try writing our own LSP decomposition for small dimension
			* can we use inv_trunc to pre-modify the input matrix, and then get an
				 "easier" instance?
   - Multiplication:
			* automatic thresholds for the variants of FFTx
			* middle product: minor issue when degree of input is small (should start by shifting)
	 - Determinant:
		  * clean (finish naive algo if necessary) + threshold
   - Improvement of approximants for small n (long term work):
      * generic algo (need some more tuning)
      * partial linearization solution Storjohann / ZhouLabahn
   - Multi-thread (long-term work):
		  * try to speed up everything when several threads


TODO Eric
   - add new multiplication function
   - fix names (mul / multiply)
   - Fix is_prime by adding primality testing
   - use NTL's TFT when available
   - do rational solve / determinant via lifting
   - write all missing functions in structured_lzz_p and structured_lzz_pX
