* agree on indent (4 spaces?) and find a way to make this go smoothly with our editors (modelines? Luca's trick?)

* please avoid spaces/tabs at end of line

* write actual docstrings?
  -- possibly for extracting into an html doc, but
  -- mostly for forcing us to document everything in a way that is more
  informative than the big header lines of /*-----*/ before every function (and
  which will be easier to work with since editors are used to these docstrings)
