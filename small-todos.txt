* agree on indent (4 spaces?) and find a way to make this go smoothly with our editors (modelines? Luca's trick?)
  --> Vincent: still have to work with 4 spaces choice, will then update my files

* when we are writing code and notice that there is a todo (functionality, doc,
  comment to write...): let's write "todo" in a comment right away, before it
  is forgotten and becomes difficult to find

* delimiters {..} :
  -- always put them even for "one-line" if/for/...  ?
  -- or allow ourselves shorter code such as
  for(blabla)
    if(bli)
      one instruction;

* please avoid spaces/tabs at end of line

* write actual docstrings?
  -- possibly for extracting into an html doc, but
  -- mostly for forcing us to document everything in a way that is more
  informative than the big header lines of /*-----*/ before every function (and
  which will be easier to work with since editors are used to these docstrings)
