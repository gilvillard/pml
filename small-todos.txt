TODO Vincent
   - Finishing PM-Basis (power series version):
      * build set of various types of matrices for input of kernel / approximant tests
      * improve mbasis_resupdate (incorporate popov_mbasis1, and threads)
      * work on thresholds (mbasis_rescomp/resupdate, and pmbasis base case)
      * algorithms for generic case in mbasis / pmbasis (uniform order and shift, no partial linearization for now)
      * compare with LinBox's pmbasis
      * compare dimension=2x1 with NTL's GCD and NTL's BerlekampMassey 
      * specific pmbasis for matrix fraction reconstruction? (input has identity)
   - Matrix multiplication:
      * FFT: decide on which algo (more thresholds?)
      * do similar improvement for geometric and others
      * test on a machine with more cores
   - Uniform interpolants:
      * mbasis: correct bug that was in mbasis_approx
      * pmbasis
      * interpolant basis verification: generation
      * algorithms for generic case in mbasis / pmbasis (uniform shift)
   - Improvement of approximants for small n:
      * generic algo (need some more tuning)
      * partial linearization solution Storjohann / ZhouLabahn
