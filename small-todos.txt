* indent = soft tab, 4 spaces
* please avoid spaces/tabs at end of line

* please insert emacs+vim modelines at the end of new files, as follows:
// Local Variables:
// mode: C++
// tab-width: 4
// indent-tabs-mode: nil
// c-basic-offset: 4
// End:

* when there is a todo (functionality, doc, comment to write...): write "todo"
  in a comment

* delimiters {..} :
  -- not required for "one-line" if/for/... , for example
		  for(blabla)
		    if(bli)
		      one instruction;
  -- at beginning of line:
       for (blabla)
       {
           blibli
       }


TODO Vincent
   - PM-Basis (power series version):
      * work on thresholds (mbasis_rescomp/resupdate, and pmbasis base case)
			* specific code for dimension 2x1 (and compare with NTL's GCD / BerlekampMassey)
			* is writing our own LSP decomposition good for small dimension?
   - Multiplication:
			* make thresholds for the variants of FFTx
		  * Clean middle product and look at variants as was done for multiplication
			* middle product: minor issue when degree of input is small (should start by shifting)
   - Uniform interpolants:
      * interpolant basis verification: generation
      * algorithms for generic case in mbasis / pmbasis (uniform shift)
   - Improvement of approximants for small n:
      * generic algo (need some more tuning)
      * partial linearization solution Storjohann / ZhouLabahn
	 - Determinant:
		  * clean (finish naive algo if necessary) + threshold
   - Multi-thread (long-term work):
		  * try to speed up everything when several threads


TODO Eric
   - add new multiplication function
   - fix names (mul / multiply)
   - Fix is_prime by adding primality testing
   - use NTL's TFT when available
   - do rational solve / determinant via lifting
   - write all missing functions in structured_lzz_p and structured_lzz_pX
